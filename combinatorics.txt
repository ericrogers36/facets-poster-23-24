Dobble - uniform block design.
Uniform since all cards (blocks) contain 8 symbols.

FROM WIKIPEDIA:

Finite projective planes are symmetric 2-designs with λ = 1 and order n > 1. For these designs the symmetric design equation becomes:

v-1 = k(k+1) WHICH GIVES US
v = k^2 + k + 1

A block design with λ = 1 and t=2 (dobble) is a Steiner system

In an alternate notation for block designs, an S(t,k,n) would be a t-(n,k,1) design.

The Dobble Problem is a Steiner System - specifically S(2,8,57)
these parameters are because:
 - 57 cards total in Dobble
 - Cards (blocks) with 8 symbols with the constraint that
 - any 2 pictures are contained in exactly one card (block)

"a PP of order n is “just” a Steiner system S(2, n+1, n^2 + n + 1)"

So dobble is a 2-(n+1,n^2+n+1,1) design.

We have a big set of unique items.

We wish to have subsets of this big set which contain a fixed, equal number of items within them.

The rule is that these subsets have to have an overlap of one item - there cannot be an overlap of two unique items between any two subsets. In effect, for any pair of items in any subset, this pair cannot reappear on any other card.

The parallel with dobble is - the items are points and the subsets are cards.

This is known as a Steiner system notated as S(2,k,n), where k is the number of blocks and n is the number of total items. (It can also be referred to as a symmetric 2-design, a 2-(n,k,1)-design.)


This can be linked to the projective plane.
From Jensen - 

Proposition. A finite projective plane of order n is a 
2−(n^2 +n+ 1, n+ 1, 1) design, 
which means it is a Steiner system 
S(2, n + 1, n2 + n + 1). 

Intuitively this means that we have n lines (blocks), n^2 + n + 1 points, and that every pairs of two points is contained in exactly one (λ = 1) line.

Dobble is nothing but a Steiner Sytem, S(2,q+1,q^2+2q+1). The reason why we have the 2 as the first parameter is that we are considering pairs. If we pick *any* 2 dobble cards, they can not share a matching pair, out of *any* of the possible pairs on that card. If they did, then we we would have 2 shared symbols on a pair of cards, which contradicts the FRoD.

Fundamental rule of dobble - any 2 cards have exactly one matching symbol
