Dobble - uniform block design.
Uniform since all cards (blocks) contain 8 symbols.

FROM WIKIPEDIA:

Finite projective planes are symmetric 2-designs with λ = 1 and order n > 1. For these designs the symmetric design equation becomes:

v-1 = k(k+1) WHICH GIVES US
v = k^2 + k + 1

A block design with λ = 1 and t=2 (dobble) is a Steiner system

In an alternate notation for block designs, an S(t,k,n) would be a t-(n,k,1) design.

The Dobble Problem is a Steiner System - specifically S(2,8,57)
these parameters are because:
 - 57 cards total in Dobble
 - Cards (blocks) with 8 symbols with the constraint that
 - any 2 pictures are contained in exactly one card (block)

"a PP of order n is “just” a Steiner system S(2, n+1, n^2 + n + 1)"

So dobble is a 2-(n+1,n^2+n+1,1) design.
