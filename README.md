# facets-poster-23-24
Poster Project for the Facets of Mathematics (MATH08068) course at the University of Edinburgh (Academic Year 23/24)

This poster explains the relationship between the projective plane and the popular card game Dobble. It achieved a mark of 37/40 (c. $\vareq 93\%$). 

In addition, a Python script with a C backend was created to generate Dobble cards, using theory described in the poster.

### Installation

If (for some bizzare reason) you wish to create your own dobble cards (who *doesn't* want their own custom dobble cards!), instructions for installation will follow in due course. It may require a bit of cleanup on our end for there to be a usable version, so watch this space. Hopefully something will be up at some point. In the meantime, feel free to read over the code and our poster :)
