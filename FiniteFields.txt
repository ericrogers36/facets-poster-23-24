 A field is a set where arithmetic behaves in accordance with the field axioms. Field axioms are a set of properties a field is required to have. These can be written in additive and multiplicative pairs. These pairs are associativity, commutativity, distributivity, identity and inverse. It is then rather intuitive that a finite field is thus a finite set of elements that satisfy these properties. The number of elements within a finite field is referred to as its order. A finite field can only exist if it has order p^k where p is a prime number and k is a positive integer. This is to say that the order of a finite field can only be prime, or a power of a prime number. Using a finite field we can build a vector space, and its associated projective plane is a finite projective plane. A finite field of order q=p^k will produce the projective plane with q^2+q+1 points and lines.
