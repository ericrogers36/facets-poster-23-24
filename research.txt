Steiner Systems?
https://blog.polettix.it/some-maths-for-dobble/

The Dobble Problem is a Steiner System - specifically S(2,8,57)
these parameters are because:
 - 57 cards total in Dobble
 - Cards (blocks) with 8 symbols with the constraint that
 - any 2 pictures are contained in exactly one card (block)

"a PP of order n is “just” a Steiner system S(2, n+1, n^2 + n + 1)"

Fundamental rule of dobble - any 2 cards have exactly one matching symbol

----
Summary (that Eric is trying to do)

Dobble is nothing but a Steiner Sytem, S(2,q+1,q^2+2q+1). The reason why we have the 2 as the first parameter is that we are considering pairs. If we pick *any* 2 dobble cards, they can not share a matching pair, out of *any* of the possible pairs on that card. If they did, then we we would have 2 shared symbols on a pair of cards, which contradicts the FRoD.

infinite projective plane and its link to dobble 


Building of Steiner systems and projective plans we can delve deeper into their relation to dobble.
Consider a game of dobble with only $7$ cards. If each point represtents a card, lines can be drawn such that if we were to chose any two of the seven points there is a line that connects them. We can say that these lines represent matching symbols on each card. So if we draw this configuration for the 7 card example we get:
\[\text{insert pic here}\]
It follows that each card constains $3$ symbols, no two cards are the same and any two cards will have one and only one matching symbol with $$ different symbols in total.
We can see that this too is a steiner system, 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $q = p^n = 2^1$
    \item $q + 1 = 3 =$ no. of symbols on each card
    \item $q^2 + q + 1 = 7 =$ no. of cards and total no. of symbols
\end{itemize}
Now we can apply this to our full sized version of Dobble.
We can start by constructing a $7\times7$ grid of points and lines such that if we choose any two of the $49$ points there is a line that connects them. This can be acheived by '' Wrapping around `` the grid.
For example:
\[\text{insert diagram here}\]
would be one line.
We are then left with a grid of $56$ lines and if we analyze it we can see that there are actually $84 different systems of $7$ parallel lines. Each collection of parallel lines converges at infinity at some point,
hense we have an additional $8$ points at infinity that can be connected with a final line. Therefore, all lines go through $8$ points.
Once again this visualises the fact that it is a Steiner system.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $q = p^n = 7^1$
    \item $q + 1 = 8 =$ no. of symbols on each card
    \item $q^2 + q + 1 = 57 =$ no. of cards and total no. of symbols
\end{itemize}

But, there are only $55$ cards in dobble? It is theorised that this is to simplify the printing process. In any case the cards can still be arranged in the same way and essentially 'skip' these points and it will still work.
