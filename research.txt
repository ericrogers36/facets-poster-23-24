Steiner Systems?

The Dobble Problem is a Steiner System - specifically S(2,8,57)
these parameters are because:
 - 57 cards total in Dobble
 - Cards (blocks) with 8 symbols with the constraint that
 - any 2 pictures are contained in exactly one card (block)

"a PP of order n is “just” a Steiner system S(2, n+1, n^2 + n + 1)"

Fundamental rule of dobble - any 2 cards have exactly one matching symbol

----
Summary (that Eric is trying to do)

Dobble is nothing but a Steiner Sytem, S(2,q+1,q^2+2q+1). The reason why we have the 2 as the first parameter is that we are considering pairs. If we pick *any* 2 dobble cards, they can not share a matching pair, out of *any* of the possible pairs on that card. If they did, then we we would have 2 shared symbols on a pair of cards, which contradicts the FRoD.
